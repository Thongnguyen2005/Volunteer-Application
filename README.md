Project: Volunteer Application
Project's purpose: The project lets people apply for voluteering by choosing the available dates and times left over for days 
between 13 and 17th December. There are 5 time slots they can choose: 8am - 8pm, 8am - 1pm, 12pm - 5pm, 3pm -8pm, and 5pm - 8pm.
However, not all of them are available since slots might be taken by other people. Therefore, the main purpose of coding is to
make the system counts how many people have chosen that specific time slot for a specific date to determine the number of slots left
and whether new volunteers can apply for that time. If all time slots of a day runs out of slot, the google from should hide the options to let the applicants know that volunteering options of that date are no longer available.
